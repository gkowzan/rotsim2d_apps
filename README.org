This package contains several GUI applications using features of =rotsim2d= library. These are mostly matplotlib plots controlled by Qt widgets.

- =rotsim2d_polarizations= :: shows values of all 7 R-factors in the high-J limit
  as a function of polarization angles. To reduce dimensionality, the first
  angle is always set to zero and the user can select which of the remaining
  three angles is fixed. The dependence on the last two angles is shown as 2D
  images.

  - place sliders, spin boxes and radio buttons for all three angles
  - add plots in a grid
  - implement blitting
